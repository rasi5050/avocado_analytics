## What Is Dash?
Dash is an open-source framework for building data visualization interfaces. Released in 2017 as a Python library, itâ€™s grown to include implementations for R, Julia, and F#. Dash helps data scientists build analytical web applications without requiring advanced web development knowledge.

#### Three technologies constitute the core of Dash:

Flask supplies the web server functionality.

React.js renders the user interface of the web page.

Plotly.js generates the charts used in your application.

## How to spin up the dashboard?

`$ git clone https://github.com/rasi5050/avocado_analytics.git`

`$ cd avocado_analytics`

`$ python -m venv venv`

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

`(venv) $ python -m pip install dash==2.8.1 pandas==1.5.3`

`python3 app.py`

Now you should be able to see the dashboard [here](http://localhost:8050).
